## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I didn't know much JavaScript, HTML, CSS. I spent some time beforehand going through
freeCodeCamps Responsive Web Design and JavaScripts Data Structures and Algorithms courses.
This made the assignment much easier. :)

Sorry for the low resolution. I needed it to fit within the allowed upload size.
